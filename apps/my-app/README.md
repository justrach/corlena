## Getting Started

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Available Routes

- **`/`** - Main landing page
- **`/scene`** - Interactive scene with physics simulation
- **`/ig`** - IG-style canvas editor (if implemented)
- **`/drawing`** - Standalone drawing canvas demo (if implemented)

## Drawing Usage

### Basic Drawing Canvas
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { SceneProvider, DomLayer, DrawingCanvas } from 'corlena/svelte';
  
  let brushColor = '#2563eb';
  let brushWidth = 3;
  
  function handlePathStart(pathId: number) {
    console.log('Started path:', pathId);
  }
  
  function handlePathComplete(pathId: number) {
    console.log('Completed path:', pathId);
  }
</script>

<SceneProvider capacity={1024} let:ready>
  <DomLayer>
    <DrawingCanvas
      width={600}
      height={400}
      {brushColor}
      {brushWidth}
      onPathStart={handlePathStart}
      onPathComplete={handlePathComplete}
    />
  </DomLayer>
</SceneProvider>
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:
